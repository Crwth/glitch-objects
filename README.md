# glitch-objects - Sample Glitch server objects

The starting point for these example objects is `PDOADP8FT3V22TI`, a player object.

Connected to this as several different object classes:

* `D*.xml` - generic data containers, used for grouping of like-data
* `B*.xml` - bags
* `I*.xml` - items
* `R*.xml` - groups, used as top level containers for things not in any location
